* To establish a visual foundation for each orbit’s relationship to Earth,
  I’ve drawn a circle with a dotted line
  that’s centered perfectly on the Earth.
  The Earth is down at the center
  of all the concentric dotted-line circles.

* Next comes the deferent:
  the larger solid circle that’s *not* centered perfectly on the Earth,
  making the planet vary in distance as it moves.
  A short tick mark shows where the two circles touch,
  at the point where the deferent is closest to the Earth.
  Motion along the deferent is not uniform,
  but faster close to the Earth and slower as the planet draws away.
  (Actually, motion along the deferent does look uniform
  when viewed from one special location: the “equant”,
  a point over on the other side of the deferent’s center from the Earth.)

* The Sun’s motion is simplest.
  It travels directly along its deferent.

* The motion of each other planet is complicated by an *epicycle:*
  a rotating circle that carries the planet along the deferent.
  An epicycle always rotates at a simple uniform speed.

* There is nothing to dictate the scale of Ptolemy’s Solar System.
  Any orbit can be scaled larger or smaller
  without changing its planet’s path as viewed from Earth,
  as long as the orbit is large enough
  that ancient observers would not discern any parallax
  between observations of a planet from different cities.
  The orbit sizes shown here are based on several suggestions of Ptolemy,
  who recognized that orbit sizes are arbitrary but suggested:

  1. The order from lowest to highest sphere
     is Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

  2. The orbits are spaced so that the planets can never swap order —
     for example, Saturn’s orbit must be large enough
     that its minimum possible apogee
     is never less than Jupiter’s maximum possible apogee.

  3. But otherwise the orbits are as tightly stacked as possible.

  4. The Moon’s distance from the Earth is 59.7 Earth radii.

* A coincidence:
  Mercury and Venus stay roughly aligned with the Sun
  instead of traveling independently along their deferents
  like the outer planets.
  Only their epicycles give them temporary visits to either side of the Sun,
  alternately into the morning sky and the evening sky.

* Another coincidence:
  the epicycles of the outer planets not only have periods of one solar year,
  but always point the same direction as the Sun!
  Not precisely, because the Sun’s equant gives it non-uniform speed
  whereas the epicycles have perfectly uniform rotation —
  but the match is still very close.
  So every one of the five lesser planets
  have some component of its motion
  that takes 365 days to complete, just like the Sun.

* These coincidences deeply bothered Copernicus,
  so he gave the Earth an orbit of its own around the Sun —
  which instantly replaced the deferents of Mercury and Venus
  and the epicycles and Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
  with the single orbit of the Earth.
  It also explained why they had always pointed in the same direction.
  This theory had a nearly fatal flaw:
  we can neither feel ourselves slinging around as the Earth rotates,
  nor feel the even vaster speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun;
  but in the long run that wound up getting explained.
