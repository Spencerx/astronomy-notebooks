So how massive would the Earth need to be for Saturn to complete its
orbit once every day?

You have: 4 * pi * pi * (1434e6 km) ** 3 / ((1 day) ** 2 * G)
You want:
        Definition: 2.3365441e+38 kg

How many solar masses is that?

You have: 2.3365441e+38 kg / 1.989e30 kg
You want:
        Definition: 1.1747331e+08

So about 117 million solar masses, about the size of the black hole at
the center of MessierÂ 105.
